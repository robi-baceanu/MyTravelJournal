# My Travel Journal

"My Travel Journal" is a simple yet elegant Android application that allows users to create, view, and edit their travel memories. It is designed to help users organize and save their travel experiences, from planning and booking trips to documenting their adventures. The app uses a SQLite database to store the user's travel memories. The project is still in development, and some functionalities are not yet implemented.

## Features

- Upon launching the app, an attractive splash screen is displayed
- The main screen displays a list of all travel memories
- By clicking on a memory, details such as a picture, the date and notes taken appear on the screen
- The user can edit or delete travel memories individually, or may opt to delete all of the saved journeys.
- Travel memories are stored using a SQLite database, so they persist upon closing the app. The offline data storage was implemented using Android Room library.
- From the "Settings" tab in the Navigation Drawer users can switch between light and dark modes.

## Upcoming features

- User register/login/logout support
- Communicating with Google Maps API and a weather API for displaying map view and weather details for each travel memory
- Language support for languages other than English
